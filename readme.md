# Landing Gear Analysis for Airbus A320 and IL76
Stress analysis is critical for determining structural safety and assembly integrity. According to the literature, the majority of aircraft construction failures are caused by landing gear system malfunction. In general, landing gear should be able to withstand significant compressive, drag, and side loads. In comparison to compressive load, side load values & drag are minuscule. As a result, it is viewed as a three-dimensional structure. It is meant to absorb the landing impact energy during landing to reduce the load imparted to the aircraft frame. Energy absorption, in addition to static strength, is a significant design consideration. For small planes, a landing gear with a lip spring is usually enough to absorb the impact energy. However, oleo pneumatic landing gear struts are the most common choice for heavier aircraft. The meah work has been done on Solidworks while the analysis is done on the Ansys
